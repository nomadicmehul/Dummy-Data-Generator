## 🔧 Customization

### Adding New Data Types
The generator is built with extensibility in mind. To add new data types:

1. Add your data type to the `dataType` select options in the HTML
2. Create a new generator function following the pattern:
```javascript
function generateYourDataType(id, companyName) {
    const complexity = document.getElementById('dataComplexity').value;
    // Your data generation logic here
    return baseRecord;
}
```
3. Add your function to the switch statement in `generateRecord()`

### Modifying Field Lists
Update the arrays at the top of the script section:
- `firstNames`, `lastNames` - Name generation
- `departments`, `skills` - Employee data
- `cities`, `countries` - Location data
- `products`, `categories` - Product data

## 📚 FAQ

### Q: Can I use this for production data?
**A:** This generates dummy/fake data only. Never use for actual production systems.

### Q: Why does generation take time for large datasets?
**A:** The browser processes everything locally for security. Large datasets (200k+ records) may take 30-60 seconds.

### Q: Can I modify the generated data?
**A:** Yes! The exported Excel/CSV files can be edited in any spreadsheet application.

### Q: Is internet required?
**A:** Only for the initial CDN library loads (Excel library). After that, it works offline.

### Q: What's the maximum file size I can generate?
**A:** Limited by your browser's memory. Most modern systems can handle 50MB+ files.

### Q: Can I run this on a server?
**A:** Yes, but it's designed for client-side use. Server deployment doesn't add security benefits since everything runs in the browser.
